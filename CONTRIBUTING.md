# Contributing
We think homelessness and eviction are serious issues that benefit from collective action, and this repository is just one tool to try to help. We want you to bring your ideas and input to make this repository more useful to everyone. 
 
## Issues
Issues are very valuable to this project.

* Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make
* Problems show where this project is lacking
* Questions that reveal where contributors can improve the user experience
* Data allows more people to benefit from the work done before them and make better decisions

Thank you for creating them.

## Data
Making data available and reliable is a key aim for this project. Policy data is hard to collect and changes often, so having a reliable source for it is incredibly valuable. We hope you'll help by contributing policy data for your county and helping us find what other data is useful in context of evictions and homelessness. 

When deciding to merge a pull request to add new data to the database, we look at the following things:

### Is the data in the correct format? 
You can find our required format at the template [here](). Data that does not fit within this format will be rejected. 

### Is this traceable and accountable? 
We require that an individual or organization be listed as the source for a contribution. We require that a contact be listed with each contribution and we'll confirm that contact's email address before approving. 

### Is the data reliable?
Non-Arup staff will not have write access to our database so that we can maintain the quality of data we want. If a contribution of data is shown to be inaccurate or incorrect, we will remove the affected entries from the database and update the pull request to reflect that. 

Once an Arup project maintainer has approved the pull request, they will be responsible for updating the database with your new data. 

## Pull requests
Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository. 

When deciding if we merge in a pull request, we look at the following things:

### Does it state intent?
You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell us anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells us the problem that you have found and that the pull request shows us the action you have taken to solve it.


### Is it of good quality?
* There are no glaring bugs or breaking changes to the existing functionality of the code
* Follows [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) conventions
* Documentation is updated to reflect new changes

You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of at least one project maintainer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Does it move this repository closer to our vision for the repository?

The aim of this repository is:

* To provide a resource for local governments, NGO's, firms, and individuals to use data to address problems arising from evictions, especially due to the effects of COVID-19.
* Make data and insights readily available to users without deep technical knowledge.
* Foster a culture of respect and gratitude in the open source community.

### Does it follow the Code of Conduct?
This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and we will remove things that do not respect it.
